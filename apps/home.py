    st.markdown('''
    Using Ghana as a case study, the project aims to discover why there is a mismatch between job opportunities and available skills. This mismatch could be caused by limited access to education and training, a lack of alignment between the education system and the needs of the job market, and a need for more resources for employers to provide training and development for their employees. To better understand this skill gap issue, this user-friendly deep learning-based NLP tool will make it easier to measure the gap between the skills and qualifications of applicants, educational or training programs, and the requirements of the job market. The team working on this project consists of experts from various continents, and the tool is currently only developed for the Ghana ecosystem.
